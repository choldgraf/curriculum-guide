<h4 id="Lecture/Lab">Lecture/Lab<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lecture/Lab"> </a></h4><p>Connector courses are held on Mondays and Tuesdays. Please discuss scheduling a time for your connector with the DSEP Curriculum Coordinator, <a href="mailto:ericvd@berkeley.edu">Eric Van Dusen</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Office-Hours">Office Hours<a class="anchor-link" href="#Office-Hours"> </a></h4><p>Instructors generally hold office hours for one hour each week. You are welcome to hold office hours wherever you find convenient. If you would like to request a computer lab for your office hours, please contact <a href="mailto:ericvd@berkeley.edu">Eric Van Dusen</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bCourses">bCourses<a class="anchor-link" href="#bCourses"> </a></h3><p><a href="https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/">bCourses</a> is Berkeley's secure gateway tool for posting course content and grades in a <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/academic-policies-procedures/ferpa">FERPA</a>-consistent way. It is similar to <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">Blackboard</a>, produced and maintained by a for-profit company, with which faculty and students coming from other schools might be more familiar. For bCourses access, please contact the department under which your course is listed. If you are teaching an L&amp;S connector course, you should contact <a href="mailto:ericvd@berkeley.edu">Eric Van Dusen</a> to receive bCourses access.</p>
<h3 id="Piazza">Piazza<a class="anchor-link" href="#Piazza"> </a></h3><p><a href="https://piazza.com/">piazza.com</a> is a useful platform for students and instructors to discuss course content. Each class can have its own Piazza website. Piazza functions best when the user base is active, which often is easier to achieve when the user base is large. The <a href="https://piazza.com/berkeley/other/cs97">connector instructor Piazza site</a> is a good example. Some instructors use Piazza exclusively and do not use bCourses.</p>
