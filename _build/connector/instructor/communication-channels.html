### Piazza

We have set up a [Piazza site](https://piazza.com/berkeley/other/cs97) for any dicussion related to connectors. This page is for connector instructors and connector assistants \(CAs\) to post questions and concerns they may have. DSEP staff members are regularly monitoring this page and will respond promptly. We are using Piazza instead of email so that communication is open and information is not confined to a private email thread. You also do not have to worry about figuring out who to email. Just post on Piazza and the right person will get back to you!
