<h1 id="What-is-a-Data-Enabled-Course?">What is a Data-Enabled Course?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is-a-Data-Enabled-Course?"> </a></h1><p>A Data-Enabled Course (DEC) is a semester-long course exploring higher-level data-driven methods in a particular domain. DECs enable students with basic data science experience to expand and apply their skills in their chosen field.</p>
<p>Some DECs are adapted from existing courses to use data science pedagogy throughout. Others are created from the ground up. In either case, a DSEP curriculum development team partners with faculty to create the necessary in-class exercises, homeworks, labs, and other materials.</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites<a class="anchor-link" href="#Prerequisites"> </a></h2><p>DECs typically require Data 8 as a prerequisite. Instructors may also recommend or require other foundational math, statistics, or computer science courses, as well as the necessary domain-specific courses.</p>
<h2 id="Data-Enabled-Courses---previous-and-planned">Data-Enabled Courses - previous and planned<a class="anchor-link" href="#Data-Enabled-Courses---previous-and-planned"> </a></h2><p>You can find a list of the currently offered DECs <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses">on the DS course list</a> under the <strong>Data Enabled Courses</strong> header.</p>
